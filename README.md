ng-di-react.js-example
======================

And example project structure using ng-di, react.js, ng-test, ng-eventRegistry

## What is it?
This project brings together a few different ideas. First it uses [ng-di](https://github.com/jmendiara/ng-di/)
to get the benefits of Angular's dependency injection without the rest of angular. For dom manipulation we have
jQuery loaded in the page but we also have React.js and Lodash.

For testing we have karma with jasmine and are using [ngTest](https://github.com/andrewluetgers/ngTest) to clean up some boilerplate.

The both the react jsx and ng-annotate parsers are working for you in the build script.
